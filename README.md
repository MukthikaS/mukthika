A High-Level Screening of 2D Retinal Fundus Images using Image Processing 

I used MatLab to work on a new algorithm to distinguish between normal eyes and diseased eyes. 
I learned and used different Image Processing techniques such as Histogram conversion, Normalization of Histogram, 
Binary image conversion, and Dilation of binary image.
